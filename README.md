Finding De Bruijn Sequences using Simulated Annealing

For details refer to project report pdf file.

For demonstration purposes the stripped down MATLAB code is for De Bruijn Sequences with alphabet size 6 and order 3. 
It takes around 6 min to run on my 13" Macbook pro 2015 base model and gives out a Energy plot hopefully reaching E=0.
